# Simple E-commerce Cart

This is a JavaScript project that I developed to showcase my skills in creating a simple e-commerce cart. It provides users with the ability to add products to their cart, adjust quantities, remove items, calculate the total cost, and complete the payment process.

Using object literal notation, I created product objects with properties like name, price, quantity, productId, and image. These objects are stored in an array, representing the available products. The cart functionality is implemented through functions that manipulate the products and the cart array.

With this project, I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in key JavaScript concepts such as array manipulation, object creation, and function implementation. It serves as an excellent addition to my portfolio, highlighting my ability to develop fundamental e-commerce features using JavaScript.

By exploring the code and functionality of this project, you can gain insights into my coding style, problem-solving approach, and understanding of basic e-commerce workflows.
